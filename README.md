# Le-Classy-Classes
Yes, said with 'la' for some nice French elegance.

A refined program of utmost purity and elegance in the discipline of classiness. Does that make sense? Naturally.

Are you classy? Or, are you not classy but still want to show off? Try that here!

Instructions are simple. This program is simple and purely for fun. It houses one class: Class (yes, class Class). You are only required one attribute, a string referred to as `name`.
You can call these methods (note, you don't need to add in any parameters as the methods will manually check inputs):

.sip_tea()
.speak_fancily()
.clean_mouth_with_high_quality_napkin()
.bloat()
.speak_check()
.auction()
.Classy() #Yes, it is uppercase. After all, who wants a common and normal lowercase word?
.seat()
.quiz() #Note, this method references another method, .correct_or_not(). Please do not directly call correct_or_not as it barely does anything by itself.
.get_class() #This method is automatically called through all other methods, but you can call it yourself directly if you want to freely become classier.

That is all!
